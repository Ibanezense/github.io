## My process

First structure the html by creating a main container for the card and then another container for the image, I preferred to put the image as a background because that way I have more control than using the img tag.

Then in css we shaped the containers, accommodating them according to the requirements and then the h1 and the paragraph, adjusting the margins and padding.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
